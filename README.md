# PersonaFind
A personalised summariser that takes an input topic from user which the user would like to know more information about and then performs the following steps:-

1) Scrapes the web for raw data related to that topic.
2) Feeds the topic to summariser and generating two summaries, basic and advanced.
3) Depending what the user prefers, the topic and its preference is stored.
4) If user asks summary about a similar topic, the type of summary associated with previous topic is displayed by default so that user doesn't have to toggle.
